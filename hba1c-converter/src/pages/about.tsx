          <p className=" text-gray-700">
            Hi, I’m Craig Sharpe, a Lead Engineer based in South Yorkshire with over 25 years of experience in IT, primarily within the financial services sector. My passion is building robust, scalable systems—especially using Golang and cloud-native technologies.
          </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            I specialise in designing and deploying distributed microservices, automating infrastructure, and driving DevOps best practices. I thrive on solving complex problems, whether that’s architecting event-driven platforms, modernising legacy systems, or ensuring reliability at scale.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 text-gray-700">
            As a technical leader, I enjoy mentoring engineers, fostering collaboration, and creating a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. I believe in clear communication and making technology accessible to everyone—technical or not.
          </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">My Artificial Pancreas Journey</h2>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-700">
          Over a decade ago, I set out to design and build my own artificial pancreas system. Using a Freestyle Libre sensor and an Accu-Chek Spirit Combo insulin pump, I engineered a homemade device that could read my blood sugar levels via RFID and send the data to my phone.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-700">
          I went as far as disassembling the Accu-Chek pump, extracting and reverse-engineering the code on its chip, and decoding its Bluetooth protocol. This allowed me to remotely adjust insulin delivery in real time.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-700">
          My system leveraged the OpenAPS algorithms by Dana Lewis, enabling closed-loop insulin automation long before commercial solutions were widely available. This project combined my engineering skills, curiosity, and drive to improve quality of life through technology.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-700">
            I moved on to use Omnipod Swift, and Loop which I used for many years; now more recently I'm using iAPS (iOS APS) which is a closed-loop system that uses the Freestyle Libre 2 sensor and the Omnipod Dash insulin pump. This system has been a game-changer for me, providing seamless integration and real-time automed adjustments to my insulin delivery.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-700">
          I’m proud to have contributed to the open-source diabetes community, sharing my findings and collaborating with others who share the same passion for innovation in healthcare technology.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-700">
          This journey has not only deepened my technical expertise but also reinforced my belief in the power of technology to transform lives. I’m excited to continue exploring new frontiers in engineering and contributing to projects that make a difference.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-700">
          If you’re interested in learning more about my journey or discussing potential collaborations, feel free to reach out. I’m always open to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities.
